    - New NeoMainMenuSceneSwitcher is a scene switcher variant that goes to the main
      menu listed in the neofps scene manager
    - Added SubSceneOperation behaviour which can be used with events (eg interactive
      object) to trigger sub-scene saves / loads

    h3Heading: Settings Changes
    bulletPoints:
    - Changed max speed setting to max step rate for motion controller / footstep
      tracking (need to modify TrackSteps motion graph behaviours if maximum steps
      per second feels wrong)
    - Added duration to AnimatorTriggerToolAction and set tool to busy while playing
    - Boosted speed and improved responsiveness, plus more jetpack fuel in jetpacks
      and missiles demo
    - Doors now have additional events for better audio, etc when interacting whilst
      opening / closing
    - Hand offsets in WieldableItemKinematics now work completely differently. You
      will need to modify in the prefab view to align hands and fingers to standard
      setup
    - FirstPersonCharacterArms component on body now needs its own HandBoneOffsets
      asset, and you can edit hand alignment in prefab view
